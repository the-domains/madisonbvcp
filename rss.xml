            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Primary Children's support system</h1><p>Needless to say, our first few weeks with Madison were stressful. Our waking days were spent almost entirely at the hospital and that can be very wearing. Fortunately for us, Primary Children's has done an amazing job setting up a support system at the hospital including the fabulous Ronald McDonald room where parents of inpatient kids can come and take a break away from all of the medical stuff. Kristen and I felt so grateful for all the outreach from the staff and social workers helping us getting used to all the ins and outs of the hospital.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8443c9f97496996a2cf585af6bcc661b0742be16.jpg"></article>]]></description>

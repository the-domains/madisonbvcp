Introduction

Hi all, this blog is for our friends and family to follow along on our journey with baby Madison and some of the unique challenges she's faced. Hopefully this can also be a resource to any families who find themselves in a similar situation and are looking for answers or just support.

### The Pregnancy

My wife Kristen had a very uneventful pregnancy. We had all of our ultrasounds and doctors appointments come back normal and even sprung for some additional out of pocket genetic screenings to make sure everything was normal. Kristen gave up wine and coffee for the whole duration of the pregnancy and being the good husband that I am, I picked up the slack for both of us. She gained a normal amount of weight and we went into the delivery room fully expecting a happy healthy little girl. 

### Labor and Delivery

On August 3rd around 9:00pm Kristen started having contractions and we went to St. Marks in Salt Lake City Utah early in the morning on August 4th to get checked out. The nurse looked her over and told us she was fully effaced but was only dilated to a 1 and sent us home with a morphine shot for Kristen so she could get some rest. She labored at home all day and we went back to the hospital at 7 pm and were admitted. Kristen continued laboring and the labor and delivery nurse noticed that during contractions Madison's heart rate would decrease a little but no one was overly concerned about it. 

Madison was born August 5 at 12:08am at 9lbs and 0 oz and it was clear something was wrong right away. she was gasping for air, and not responding normally so the took her straight to the NICU there at St Marks and intubated her. Their initial diagnosis was a double pneumothorax(small hole in each lung putting air around her lungs) and

[PPHN(primary pulmonary hypertension of the newborn)][0]

. They intubated her and put a tube in her side to drain out the air, but she wasn't recovering her oxygen levels well enough so they arranged transport to Primary Children's hospital here in Salt Lake City. for more advanced care.

### The first Day at Primary Children's

Madison arrived at Primary Children's around 3pm on august 5th stable but in very critical condition. The doctors evaluated her and told us she wasn't responding to the conventual treatments for her PPHN they had tried and our final remaining option was to place her on[ECMO(][1]

[Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation)][1]

. ECMO is basically a heart lung bypass which allows the baby's heart and lungs to take a break and relax but it has a very high rate of side effects from hearing loss to brain bleeds leading to brain damage or even death. Dr. Malleske was the neonatologist overseeing her at admission and felt that she was a very good candidate for ECMO so she went onto it at 6pm that day. They have to overhydrate babies who go onto ECMO and warned us she would look swollen but we really weren't prepared for how Madison would actually look on ECMO.The surgery to put her on ECMO went perfectly and Madison stabilized right away. It was hard to see our beautiful little girl hooked up to all these wires but knowing she had a shot of coming through all of this gave us hope. If anyone is reading this is in a similar situation please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I know how overwhelming all of this can be and how hopeless it can feel, but there can be a light at the end of the tunnel.

Love,

Kristen, Ken and Madison

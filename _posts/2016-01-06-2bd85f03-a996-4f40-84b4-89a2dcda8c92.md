### Primary Children's support system

Needless to say, our first few weeks with Madison were stressful. Our waking days were spent almost entirely at the hospital and that can be very wearing. Fortunately for us, Primary Children's has done an amazing job setting up a support system at the hospital including the fabulous Ronald McDonald room where parents of inpatient kids can come and take a break away from all of the medical stuff. Kristen and I felt so grateful for all the outreach from the staff and social workers helping us getting used to all the ins and outs of the hospital.

### Weaning Medications and First Extubation

Madison spent the first part of her second week just weaning of all the medications she was on for her heart and lungs. It was a great time for us because we were seeing dramatic improvements almost

every day. We saw our daughter start opening her eyes, and with the reduced pain meds, actually start interacting with us! Even the doctors and nurses were impressed at how well she was recovering after such a difficult start to life. Kristen and I started making plans to take her home and the rest of the hospital stay started to feel like a formality. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/45058fd7-8b89-4452-a855-ff047235daf6.jpg)

Towards the end of that week, the doctors felt she was doing so well that they were ready to extubate her. This was a huge step for us, because it was the first time she was going to be breathing on her own. So on Friday, August 15th they took out her breathing tube and put her on oxygen through a nasal cannula. When she came off of the breathing tube she was heavily sedated and was having what they call[Stridor][0]. She was still able to breathe, but it was very obvious looking at her that she was struggling. The doctors thought that it might be swelling from having been intubated for the better part of two weeks and were hoping she would get better if they just let her rest. She made it about 15 hours before her pain medicine wore off enough for her to try and cry she closed off her airway and they had to reintubate her.

This was a tough time for Kristen and me. Partially because it was so hard to see our little girl struggle and not know what was wrong. But also because we had jumped ahead to seeing ourselves with a happy healthy baby, and our time at Primary Children's just a vague memory. Now we were having to come to terms with the fact that there may be something wrong with her that would be a longer term issue.

### Steroids and the Second Extubation

After they reintubated Madison we talked with the doctors about what they thought the problem might be. They still thought it was swelling and thought the best course of action would be to give her a dose of steroids to help the swelling and then try extubation again. 

The whole steroid treatment took almost a week to administer and during that time we got to be with our baby again. Even though it was hard seeing her intubated, it was nice seeing her not struggle with breathing and being able to hold her again. After the course of steroids they tried extubating her again and this time she made it nearly 70 hours on a nasal cannula with the same stridorous breathing she had the first time before they realized something was very wrong and got an ENT consult. The ENT doctor looked down her throat with a flexible camera and diagnosed her with bilateral vocal cord paralysis and recommended she get a tracheostomy as soon as possible.

This was pretty tough news to get. After all the difficulty Madison had right out of the gate with PPHN and being on ECMO for 3 days, there was still the chance that when we walked out of the hospital she was going to be a normal baby and we were going to be able to look back at our time in the hospital as something that happened in the past. Now we were facing the reality that Madison had a condition that was going to follow us back from the hospital and into the first few years of her life at least.

As hard as is was to come to terms with Madison's diagnosis, the idea that we finally knew what was wrong, and could start doing something to help her really helped Kristen and I keep a positive frame of mind. Within just a few days, the ENT group had Madison on the schedule for her tracheostomy and we found ourselves going down for the las surgery of the day. It was one of the most nerve racking times I've ever spent in my life, but finally, around 10pm they let us go see her and it went perfectly!

### First Day with a Trach

Getting used to seeing a trach can be really tough. But seeing how much happier Madison was without being intubated made the Trach fade into the background really quickly. Now our focus finally shifted to weaning her from her meds, and getting her ready to finally come home!
